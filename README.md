# Virtudemy - Introduction to a revolutionized virtual learning environment.

The era of being confined within four walls to be educated has now become a conventional concept. It has several limitations ranging from a dull teacher driven classroom, inflexible curriculums and timings to a restricted reach to enhance oneâ€™s knowledge.

With Virtudemy, a revolutionized method of virtual learning, students will be able to negate and overcome all the disadvantages of a real time classroom while keeping the benefits it provides. 

Virtudemy is basically a multi-user tool that can help the teachers and students alike to modify, rectify and enhance their own strategies of learning and imparting knowledge. Virtudemy takes an Open World Multiplayer approach, where the students can execute several in-classroom activites and interactions with their professors with ease at several different places on the 3D modelled map.

# Technical Overview

Virtudemy is an online, multiuser Education tool based on the Unity Game Engine and programmed using the C# programming language. It can be run on Local-Area Networks (LAN) in school labs and classes, or can be hosted on a server with ports forwarded to be accessible outside the school campus.

The open world video-game style was designed and created in the Unity Game Engine, with the map modelled and textured using the Blender modelling tool. The tool allows students to login and join a first-person POV and experience a school map filled with activities and events set up by the hosting school. The prospective of a video-game styled environment allows Virtudemy to be effective as well as interesting for students of all age groups.
